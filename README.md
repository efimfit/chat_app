## Technical description

Flutter 3.3.10 â€¢ Dart 2.18.6

Authentication and work with data are implemented using official Firebase plugins (aka Firebase SDK):
- `cloud_firestore 4.3.1`
- `firebase_core 2.4.1`
- `firebase_auth 4.2.4`
- `firebase_storage 11.0.10`
- `firebase_messaging 14.2.1`

This made it possible to work with such Firebase services as:
- Authentication
- Firestore database (for storing users and their messages)
